<h1><a name="_dialogbox_aerodynamic-setup"></a>Aerodynamic Setup</h1>

<p>The Aerodynamic Setup dialog box is used to define the air environment
for the wind turbine, and to set up some control parameters for the
aerodynamic load calculation in the AeroDyn module
(<a href="javascript:aerodyn.Click()">nrel.gov/wind/nwtc/aerodyn.html</a>).
A separate input file to AeroDyn is generated based on the contents of this dialog.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/dlg-aerodynamic-setup.png" width="268" height="377"></p>

<p>The fields in this dialog box are as follows:<ul>

<li><i>Dynamic stall model</i> -
Specify BEDDOES to use the Beddoes-Leishman dynamic stall model,
or STEADY for quasi-steady airfoil characteristics.
It is recommended to use the BEDDOES model in most situations.

<li><i>Use aerodynamic pitching moment mode</i> -
This option enables the calculation of aerodynamic pitching moment.
The Airfoil files must then include pitching moment coefficients (CM).

<li><i>Inflow model</i> -
This option controls the dynamic inflow option.
Specify GDW to use a Generalized Dynamic Wake inflow model to calculate
the induction factor, or BEM to use the Blade Element Momentum theory
with skewed wake and tip loss corrections.
The direct calculation method of GDW is considerably faster than the iterative
method of the BEM option, which assumes that the wake is always in equilibrium
with the forces on a blade element. See Appendix E of the
<a href="javascript:userguide.Click()">AeroDyn User's Guide</a>
for more information on the dynamic inflow method employed with the GDW option.

<li><i>Induction-factor model</i> -
This option controls the wake or induced velocity calculation.
There are three possible choices, WAKE, SWIRL and NONE.
Specify SWIRL to calculate both axial and tangential induction.
If WAKE is specified, only the axial induction will be calculated.
If NONE is specified, the induced velocity calculation will be completely
bypassed and all induction factors areset to zero.
This option is available primarily to assist the debugging of new models.
We suggest that in the first tests of a new model, ignore the wake to accelerate
the calculations and eliminate the possibility of convergence problems in the
induction factor iteration.
A warning is generated by AeroDyn when NONE is used to remind the user that
this is a highly unusual situation.

<li><i>Induction-factor tolerance</i> -
This is the tolerance used for convergence testing in the iterative solution
to find the induction factor, &alpha;, when using the GDW inflow model.
The default value 0.005 should be used unless there are compelling reasons
to do otherwise.
Sometimes it is desirable to change this value to avoid convergence problems
(with some loss of accuracy) or to speed up the calculations.
The value represents the maximum allowed difference between two successive
estimates of &alpha;.
That is, if the new estimate of &alpha; differs from the estimate from the
previous iteration by an amount less than the tolerance, the solution has
converged and the last value of &alpha; is used.

<li><i>Tip-loss model</i> -
This option controls the tip loss model (used with the BEM inflow model only).
There are three possible choices, PRAND, GTECH and NONE.
PRAND is the Prandtl tip loss model, GTECH is the Georgia Tech correction
to the Prandtl model, whereas NONE turns off the tip loss correction altogether.
The GTECH model is intended to better model the effects of the relatively large
inflow velocities (compared to hovering rotors, for which the Prandtl model was
developed) experienced by wind turbine rotors spacing the tip vortex rings
farther apart in the wake.

<li><i>Hub-loss model</i> -
This option controls the hub loss model (used with the BEM inflow model only).
There are two possible choices, PRAND, and NONE.
PRAND invokes the Prandtl tip loss model, to be used to determine hub losses,
whereas NONE turns off the hub loss correction altogether.
This option is intended to model losses experienced by the rotor blade elements
close to the rotor hub. Generally, these effects are of little consequence.

<li><i>Wind definition</i> -
This part of the dialog is used to define the undisturbed wind field
to be used in the aerodynamic load calculation.
<ul>
<li><i>Constant wind</i> - Enable this toggle to specify a constant wind
using the <i>Wind speed</i> and <i>Wind direction</i> fields.
The wind direction value is the angle (in degrees) between the rotor plane
normal (with zero shaft tilt) and the wind direction, see Section 7.1 in the
<a href="javascript:userguide.Click()">AeroDyn User's Guide</a>.
<li><i>Wind file</i> - When the <i>Constant wind</i> toggle is disabled,
you may use the <i>Browse...</i> button to select a separate input file
describing the wind field.
This can either be hub-height wind data file, or a full-field turbulent wind
data file, described in Chapter 7 and 8, respectively, in the
<a href="javascript:userguide.Click()">AeroDyn User's Guide</a>.
<li><i>Create turbulent wind..</i> - Click this button to launch the
<a href="3d-turbulent-wind.htm">FEDEM TurbWind</a> tool
to create a full-field turbulent wind data file for the current model.
</ul>

<li><i>Tower influence</i> -
This part of the dialog is used to set up the tower influence on the wind field.
<ul>
<li><i>Use potential flow model</i> - Enables the use of a tower influence model
based on potential flow solution around a cylinder, as described in the
<a href="javascript:theoryguide.Click()">AeroDyn Theory Manual</a>.
This model provides the influence of the tower on the local velocity field at
all points around the tower, including increases in wind speed around the sides
and the cross-stream velocity component in the tower-near flow field.
<li><i>Include downwind tower shadow</i> - Enables the use of a tower wake
(velocity deficit) model for downwind rotors.
This toggle has no effect for upwind turbines.
<li><i>Tower drag file</i> - When one or both of the two tower influence
toggles are enabled, a tower drag file must be specified.
It lists the drag coefficient for the tower as function of the Reynold's
number and the tower diameter.
</ul>

<li><i>Air density</i> -
Specifies the ambient air density.

<li><i>Kinematic air viscosity</i> -
Specifies the kinematic air viscosity.
This value is used in AeroDyn to calculate the local element Reynold's number,
which can be used to move between multiple tables in the airfoil files.

<li><i>Time step for aerodynamic calculations</i> -
Specifies the time step size (<i>dtAD</i>) used by AeroDyn.
Since the time integration steps in the dynamics solver (<i>dt</i>) often are
quite small, the dynamics simulation can run faster and be more immune to
numerical stability problems if <i>dtAD</i> is specified larger than <i>dt</i>,
but still less than the time scale for the changes in aerodynamic forces.
Typically, the aerodynamic forces should not be expected to change faster than
the time it takes the blade to rotate 2.4&deg;, e.g., if a rotor runs at 30 rpm,
it will take 0.02 seconds for the blade to move 3.6&deg; such that
<i>dtAD</i> = 0.02 will then repeat the aerodynamic calculations often enough
to catch the true variations in the loads.
Since the time stepping is controlled by the FEDEM dynamics solver,
the aerodynamic calculations will be repeated after a time interval that is
at least <i>dtAD</i> (but less than <i>dtAD</i>+<i>dt</i>).
That is, the aerodynamic calculations are not necessarily repeated exactly at
the intervals <i>dtAD</i>.

<li><i>Use same time step as dynamics solver</i> -
Enable this toggle to ignore the <i>Time step for aerodynamic calculations</i>
value and always use the same step size in AeroDyn as in the dynamics solver,
i.e., <i>dtAD</i> = <i>dt</i>.

</ul></p>
