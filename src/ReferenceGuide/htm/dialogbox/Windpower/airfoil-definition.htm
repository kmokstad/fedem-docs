<h1><a name="_dialogbox_airfoil-definition"></a>Airfoil Definition</h1>

<p>The purpose of the Airfoil Definition dialog box is to study and modify
a set of Airfoils, which are used in the <a href="blade-definition.htm">Blade Definition</a>
dialog box to define the blades of wind turbine model. An Airfoil is basically a cross
section of the blade where the different aerodynamic properties are specified.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/dlg-airfoil-definition.png" width="570" height="459"></p>

<p>FEDEM WindPower uses the same airfoil file format as AeroDyn.
The Airfoil dialog box is thus simply an editor for such files.
See the AeroDyn documentation (<a href="javascript:aerodyn.Click()">nrel.gov</a>)
for information on this file format.</p>

<p>A set of sample Airfoils (provided by NREL) is included with the FEDEM Windpower
package (see the Properties\AeroData sub-folder of the installation).
In some projects, the user may be less concerned with the blade designs,
and most of these Airfoils will be sufficient. But, in other projects,
the user may wish to provide their own Airfoils.<p>

<p>On the left side of the Airfoil definition dialog box, some global definitions are given:<ul>

<li><i>Name</i> -
Provides the name of the Airfoil file.

<li><i>Number of airfoil tables in this file</i> -
Airfoil files are designed so that they can contain many airfoils.
The Airfoil file in the figure above contains a single Airfoil table.

<li><i>Table ID parameter</i> -
Provides an identifier for each Airfoil table.

<li><i>Stall angle [deg]</i> -
Provides the stall angle (in degrees).

<li><i>Zero C<sub>n</sub> angle of attack [deg]</i> -
Provides the zero-lift angle-of-attack of the AirFoil.
Only used for Beddoes dynamic stall model.

<li><i>C<sub>n</sub> slope for zero lift (dimensionless)</i> -
Provides the static Cn curve slope near zero lift.

<li><i>C<sub>n</sub> extrapolated to value at positive stall angle of attack</i> -
Provides the C<sub>n</sub> value at positive static stall.
This is the nominal stall for positive and increasing angles-of-attack.

<li><i>Cn at stall value for negative angle of attack</i> -
Provides the C<sub>n</sub> value at the negative static stall angle of attack.

<li><i>Angle of attack for minimum C<sub>D</sub>[deg]</i> -
Provides the angle of attack for the minimum drag coefficient.
<li><i>Minimum C<sub>D</sub> value</i> -
Provides the minimum drag coefficient of the AirFoil.</ul>

On the right side of the Airfoil definition dialog box,
The Airfoil table data (lift and drag coefficients) is given:

<p><ul>
<li><i>alpha</i> - This is the angle of attack.
The table must be written in order of increasing angle of attack.
It is preferable to use a table for angles in the range -180 to +180 degrees.
The coefficient values should be the same at -180 and +180 degrees to avoid discontinuity.

<li><i>CL</i> - Static lift coefficient.
<li><i>CD</i> - Drag coefficient.
<li><i>CM</i> - Pitching moment coefficient.

</ul></p>

<p>The <i>Add Row</i> and <i>Delete Row</i> buttons can be used to add and remove rows in the table.</p>
