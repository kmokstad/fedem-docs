<h1><a name="_dialogbox_3d-turbulent-wind"></a>Turbulent Wind</h1>

<p>The FEDEM TurbWind tool is used to generate turbulent wind files for the
<a href="aerodynamic-setup.htm">Air Environment</a> dialog box in FEDEM Windpower.
It is basically a front end for the TurbSim simulator (v1.06)
by NREL (<a href="javascript:turbsim.Click()">nrel.gov</a>).</p>

<p>FEDEM sends some key parameters of the wind turbine to the TurbWind tool when it is launched.
This include such quantities as hub height, grid height, time step, duration, output folder,
reference height, etc. You may adjust these values to match your wind turbine and conditions.</p>

<p><ul>
<li><i>Hub height</i> -
Specifies the hub height of the turbine for which the inflow is being generated.
This parameter is used as a reference height for determining the grid location.

<li><i>Grid height</i> -
This parameter is the distance between the top and bottom of the grid.
The top of the grid is assumed to be aligned with the top of the rotor disk,
and because all points of the grid must be above ground level, 0.5*GridHeight < HubHeight.

<li><i>Grid width</i> -
This parameter is the width of the grid.
The rotor is assumed to be centered horizontally on the grid.
If you are generating FF files for AeroDyn, the grid width—like the height—must
be large enough to ensure that no part of the blade lies outside the grid,
even when the system is displaced.

<li><i>Num. grid Z</i> -
Specifies the number of grid points to generate in the vertical direction.
It must be an integer greater than 1.

<li><i>Num. grid Y</i> -
Specifies the number of grid points to generate in the horizontal direction.
It must be an integer greater than 1.

<li><i>Time step</i> -
The time step is set to 0.05 seconds in the sample input files,
and that value is recommended for most simulations.
The time step determines the maximum frequency,
f<sub>max</sub>=1/TimeStep, used in the inverse FFT.

<li><i>Duration</i> -
Sets the analysis time and usable time in the TurbSim input file.

<li><i>IEC turbine class</i> -
IEC turbulence characteristic ("A", "B", "C" or TI in %) or KHTEST.

<li><i>Template file</i> -
TurbSim input file (.inp) to use as template.

<li><i>Output folder</i> -
The folder where output files will be stored.

<li><i>Turbulence type</i> -
This parameter indicates which IEC wind model will be used.
Valid entries, which are found in the TurbSim User's Guide,
include the Normal Turbulence Model (NTM), Extreme Turbulence
Model (ETM), and Extreme Wind Speed Model (EWM) using the
10-minute average wind speed with a recurrence period of 1 year or
50 years. Note that the EWM scaling parameters in TurbSim are valid
only for 10-minute simulations. The definitions of these models and
of the wind turbine classes can be found in the IEC 61400-1 standard
(3rd ed.). If the IEC turbine class (IECturbc) parameter was specified as
a percentage instead of as a standard turbulence category, the wind
model must be "NTM." This input is used only with the IEC spectral models.

<li><i>Wind speed</i> -
Specifies the mean streamwise wind speed at the reference height.
It is the mean value over the entire AnalysisTime
length of the simulation of the u-component wind speed.
It must be a positive value in units of meters per second.

Ref. height</i> -
Specifies the height of the corresponding reference wind speed.
This parameter enables users to specify the mean wind
speed at a height other than the hub height. TurbSim uses this
reference height and wind speed with the wind profile type to
calculate the HH mean wind speed.

<li><i>PLExp</i> - Power-Law Exponent.
This parameter is used to compute the mean u-component wind speeds
across the rotor disk when WindProfileType is "IEC" or "PL."

<li><i>Include tower points</i> -
Determines whether TurbSim generates binary tower time series,
which contain points in a line at the tower centerline
from the bottom of the rectangular grid to the ground.

<li><i>Random seed 1</i> -
This input parameter is used in conjunction with the parameter RandSeed2 of the inp-file;
it tells TurbSim how to initialize the pRNG value. This random seed must be an integer between
–2147483648 and 2147483647 (inclusive).
The random numbers generated by the pRNG are used to create
random phases (one per frequency per grid point per wind
component) for the velocity time series. When the pRNG is initialized
in the same way (i.e., RandSeed1 and RandSeed2 are not changed),
the user can reproduce the same random phases between runs,
which is useful in comparing the effects of changes to other input
parameters. Random numbers also are used to generate some default
input values and the superimposed coherent structures for the
non-IEC spectral models.</ul></p>

<p>All values are in SI units.
Please study the TurbSim documentation for more details on these parameters.</p>

<p>Click the <i>Generate</i> button to run TurbSim and generate the wind files.
The console output from TurbSim is listed in the lower text area.</p>

<p>The basic operation of the tool is to read a template input file,
modify some of its data fields, and output wind files in the output folder.
The tool generates subfolders (based on the turbulence type field) and file names
(based on the wind speed field).</p>
