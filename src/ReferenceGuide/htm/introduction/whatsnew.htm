What's New</h1>

<h2>New features with release 8.0</h2>

<p>The FEDEM software is now open source (<a href="https://openfedem.org/">openfedem.org</a>).
See the <a href="https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-gui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">fedem-gui/CHANGELOG</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">fedem-solvers/CHANGELOG</a>
files for a summary of changes in release 8.0 and beyond. The list here is no longer maintained.</p>

<h2>New features with release 7.6</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Export of Digital Twin cloud simulation apps.</b>
	A new dialog box for exporting the current model to a cloud simulation app
	is now available. This also includes export to a FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).
	The new dialog is launched from the <i>File</i> menu and replaces the two
	commands for exporting Stream- and Batch apps directly.

	<li><b>Stress- and Strain Rosette recovery during dynamics simulation.</b>
	Toggles for performing recovery of internal displacements and strains/stresses
	are available in the Advanced tab of the Part property panel.

	<li><b>Smooth ramp-up of input loads/motions and gravity forces.</b>
	Toggles and fields for doing a smooth ramp-up of the loads over a specified
	time domain are available in the Initial Equilibrium tab of the Solver setup dialog box.
	This can be used instead of (or as a supplement to) the initial static equilibrium iterations.

	<li><b>Scaling and shift for External functions.</b>
	The property panel for <i>External funcion</i> now contains fields for applying
	a scaling factor and a shift value, in similar way as for the Polyline from file functions.
</ul>


<h2>New features with release 7.5</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Parabolic shell finite elements.</b>
	6-noded trinagular and 8-noded quadrilateral shell elements
	are now available for the FE reduction and linear FE analysis modules.

	<li><b>Overwrite FE reductions.</b>
	A new toggle in the Model Preferences dialog box has been added,
	which allows you to overwrite the existing FE reduction results instead
	of creating a new sub-folder parallel to the folder containing the old
	reduction results of that FE part.

	<li><b>Stress recovery of FE parts.</b>
	The "Linear analysis" option on FE parts can now be followed by a stress
	recovery using the computed displacements from the linear analysis.
	The resulting stresses can then be plotted in an Animation object in
	the usual manner, but the animation will only contain a single frame.

	<li><b>Co-rotated reference coordinate system.</b>
	For the default method (Max triangle with scaled offset), the tolerance
	used to decide whether an offset is applied to the third triad picked
	is now configurable by editing the model file. The default tolerance is
	now 5\% of the distance between the first to Triads. It used to be 50\%.

	<li><b>Object-level output control.</b>
	A new Results tab is added in the property panel for some object types
	where the output of specific result quantitites can be specified.

	<li><b>Object tags.</b>
	The property panel now has a new <i>Tag</i> field to the right of the
	Description field, in which a tag may be assigned to the object.
	The tag may be used to reference the objects in python modelling scripts
	instead of using the base ID.

	<li><b>External functions from file.</b>
	A text file may now be specified as input for the solver, from which it
	will read the values of the external functions for each time step
	instead of expecting them to be assigned by an external process.

	<li><b>Export of Digital Twin cloud simulation apps.</b>
	Commands for exporting current model to a cloud simulation app (zip-file)
	is now available from the <i>File</i> menu.

	<li><b>Reverse direction of Cylindric/Prismatic Joints.</b>
	A new button is added under the topology panel in the Property view for
	Cylindric- and Prismatic Joints. It changes the direction of the joint
	by reversing the master triad connectivity list.
</ul>


<h2>New features with release 7.4</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Detection of externally reduced FE parts.</b>
	If an FE part has been reduced manually outside the GUI (e.g., by using
	the "Prepare for batch execution" feature, the reduced matrix files
	are automatically detected when the model is opened in the GUI afterwards.

	<li><b>Improved stress animation.</b>
	Stresses in solid elements can now be plotted together with shell
	Top/Bottom surface stresses, if the model contains both types of elements.

	<li><b>Frequency response analysis.</b>
	Loads and prescribed motions on Triad- and Joint DOFs can now be
	applied in the frequency domain instead of time domain.

	<li><b>Creating new modelling configuration from simulation.</b>
	The <b>Save As...</b> dialog box has been extended to allow creation
	of a new stress-free modelling configuration for the saved model,
	based on a specified state of the current simulation.

	<li><b>Overwrite results.</b>
	A new toggle in the Output tab of the Solver setup dialog box has been added,
	which allows you to overwrite the existing simulation results instead of
	incrementing the resultsdatabase using the "Delete results" button.

	<li><b>FE beam visualization.</b>
	Beam elements with eccentricities in FE models are now visualized in
	their eccentric position with respect to the connected nodal poinst.
	The local orientation of the element is also indicated with a short line
	in the local XZ-plane of the element, extending from the mid-point of the
	beam axis forming a 45-degree angle with the beam axis towards local end 1.
</ul>


<h2>New features with release 7.3</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Utility for solution mapping.</b>
	A new program module <i>fedem_solmap</i> is provided for extracting nodal displacements
	from one model to use as boundary conditions on a refined sub-model.

	<li><b>Improved support for (quasi-)static simulation of big models.</b>
	It is now possible to skip the mass matrix reduction, and also the calculation of gravitation forces,
	if they are not needed in a pure quasi-static simulation, in order to save computation time.
	It is also possible to run the solver in a linar static mode, where each step is
	considered an independent load case and no incrementation or iterations are performed.

	<li><b>Eigenvalue analysis of FE parts.</b>
	The "Linear analysis" option on FE parts can now be used to perfrom an eigenvalue analysis
	of the part, without reducing it. The mode shapes of this analysis can be animated by
	selecting "Eigenmodes of non-reduced part" in the Animation property panel.

	<li><b>Mooring line generation.</b>
	A command for generation of mooring lines has been added.
	It will create a catenary curve of beam elements, or any two-noded user-defined element.

	<li><b>Beam cross section database.</b>
	A database with some standard cross sections is provided with the installation,
	as a set of csv-files in the <i>Properties/CrossSections</i> folder.
	A new dialog is then provided in the GUI from which the desired cross section(s)
	can be imported into the FEDEM model.

	<li><b>Generalized-&alpha; time integration.</b>
	The Newmark time integration algorithm has been extended to also cover the generalized-&alpha; method.

	<li><b>Grouping of beam result quantities.</b>
        Triad result quantities that are related to the local coordinate system of the (first) beam element
        the Triad is connected to, are now placed in a sub-group named "Beam quantities".

	<li><b>Shell elements.</b>
	The three- and four-noded shell elements used in FE parts are now based on the ANDES formulation.

	<li><b>SESAM FEM file format.</b>
	The SESAM input interface file parser now supports BELFIX and BLDEP.

	<li><b>Strain Rosette position and orientation.</b>
	The strain rosettes can now measure their absolute position through
	the position vector and the Euler angles describing its orientation.

	<li><b>Strain Rosette quantities as Function arguments.</b>
	It is now possible to select Strain Rosettes as arguments to
	General Functions.

	<li><b>Graph view font size.</b>
	The font size of the Graph title and axis labels
	can now be customized in the Graph property panel.

	<li><b>Disable simulation stop time.</b>
	A toggle has been added in the Dynamics Solver setup dialog that
	can disable the specified Stop time. If disabled, the solver will
	continue to run indefinitly, or until it is stopped for other reasons.

	<li><b>Linear static analysis of FE parts.</b>
	A new "Linear analysis" item has been added under the <i>Solve</i> menu,
	which appears when right-clicking on an FE part.
	This will perform a direct static linear elastic analysis of that part.

	<li><b>Dynamics solver API.</b>
	The solvers are now built as shared object libraries (DLL's on windows),
	containing an API that makes it possible to interact with the solution
	process via Python scripts, etc.
</ul>


<h2>New features with release 7.2</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Nastran DMAP files.</b>
	A new DMAP-file for NX Nastran has been added in the Templates folder.
	The old DMAP file located there has been updated for work with
	MSC.Nastran 2005r1 and 2005r2.

	<li><b>New math expression functions.</b>
	The mod operator (a%b) may now be used in math expression functions.
	Also the functions max(a,b) and min(a,b) have been added.

	<li><b>External functions.</b>
	A new function type called <i>External funcion</i> is now availabe.
	These functions have no arguments or parameters, and are used as input
	channels from external programs or scripts.

	<li><b>User-defined wave functions.</b>
	The user-defined function API has been extended to also cover wave
	functions, that can be used in hydrodynamic load calculations.

	<li><b>Measurement of distances and angles.</b>
	Two new commands have been added in the <i>Tools</i> menu, that allows you
	to measure the relative distance between two points, and the angle of
	rotation from one point to another about a specified rotation centre.

	<li><b>Toggle visualization of various Joint types.</b>
	Separate toggles for the various Joint types have been added in the
	General Appearance dialog.

	<li><b>Picking of FE nodes.</b>
	The FE node ID and its global or local coordinates are now displayed in the Part property panel when picking in the Modeler view.

	<li><b>Pan and zoom on graphs using mouse.</b>
	A graph view can now be zoomed using the mouse wheel, and panned by pressing the right mouse button while moving the mouse.
	This replaces using the F2 and F1 keys, respectively, while moving the mouse.

	<li><b>Creating Subassemblies.</b>
	A Subassembly may now be created from a group of selected objects.

	<li><b>Mass properties for Generic parts.</b>
	Generic parts may now be assigned a Material property object in the property panel.
	The mass, inertia and centre of gravity of the Part may then be calculated
	based on the mass density of the assigned Material property,
	and the geometry (.vrml or .ftc file) associated with it.

	<li><b>Surface connectors on Triads.</b>
	The type of the surface connector, whether it is Flexible or Rigid, can now be
	set on the Triad property panel, also after the connector has been generated.
	When a Triad has a cylinder surface connector associated with it,
	the geometry of the cylinder is displayed when the Triad is highlighted.

	<li><b>Creating Joints on existing triads.</b>
	We have added new commands in the main toolbar for creation of Free-, Prismatic- and Cylindric Joints from selected existing Triads.
	The Joints created by these commands are automatically attached to the selected Triads (no need for separate Attach operations).

	<li><b>Setting all DOFs Fixed or Free.</b>
	We have added two buttons in the Triad and Joint property panels,
	which can be used to set all DOFs in the Triad/Joint either Fixed or Free.
</ul>


<h2>New features with release 7.1</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>FEDEM Addons/API.</b>
	We have increased the flexibility of the FEDEM user interface by allowing for add-on applications
	through a separate top-level menu. The FEDEM Addons are individual programs that communicate with
	the main user interface through a COM API. The FEDEM Addons may be programmed in many different
	languages, such as C#, Visual Basic, Python, etc. Included addons:
	<br><br><ul>
	<li><b><i>Connect.</i></b> Connect is an assistive tool to simplify the process of connecting Triads, nodes on FE parts, and the Ground with a Joint.
	<li><b><i>Scatter.</i></b> The Scatter application is used to import and manage wave scatter diagrams for the FEDEM event system.
	<li><b><i>Soil Creator.</i></b> Soil Creator is used to apply soil springs to a Beamstring based on user-defined p-y, t-z and q-z curves.
	</ul>

	<li><b>User-defined elements.</b>
	We have added a C++ and Fortran API for user-defined elements in the FEDEM dynamics solver.
	Advanced users may then program their own specialized elements, with Newton matrix
	and right-hand-side load vector contributions to enter the linearized system of equations.

	<li><b>Fortran API for user-defined functions.</b>
	User-defined function plugins may now be implemented in the Fortran language.
	A separate Fortran template file is included with the installation.

	<li><b>Create Beamstring functionality.</b>
	We have added a command for defining a single beam element between two selected Triads,
	or a Beamstring through a sequence of three or more Triads.

	<li><b>Split Beam into several pieces.</b>
	A command for splitting a beam element into several elements of equal length has been added.
	The command may be invoked repeatedly to create a non-uniform length distribution.

	<li><b>Local beam element orientation.</b>
	The local beam orientation vector may now be edited in the property panel.

	<li><b>Partial visualisation of pipe cross sections.</b>
	The start and stop angle for a partial visualisation of pipe cross sections
	may now be defined in the Beam property panel.

	<li><b>Duplication of objects.</b>
	Functions of any type, Beam properties, Beam material properties and RAO objects
	may now be duplicated through a "Copy Object" right-click menu entry in the Model Manager panel.

	<li><b>Prismatic and Cylindric Joints along a Beamstring.</b>
	Prismatic and Cylindric Joints may now be attached to Beamstrings, provided that the beam elements
	are along the line between the two (end) master Triads of the Joint.
	All beam nodes in between then automatically become master Triads as well.

	<li><b>Fixed nodes in FE parts.</b>
	Flexible FE parts may now contain fixed nodes, such that they will appear as fixed to ground in all those nodes.
	This will reduce the computational cost for such models considerably, where the alternative is to use large rigid spiders
	connecting all the nodes to be fixed to a reference node which then is fixed to ground via a Triad.

	<li><b>Import of Subassemblies from file.</b>
	It is now possible to import an existing FEDEM model as a Subassembly into another FEDEM model.
	A Subassembly may also be saved in a separate file and reused in another FEDEM model by importing it.

	<li><b>Scaling function for wave-induced hydrodynamic forces.</b>
	A new field in the Sea Environment dialog has been added, where a hydrodynamic force scaling function may be specified.
	This is useful, e.g., if you need to perform a quasistatic equilibirum analysis over several time increments
	in the beginning of a simulation with loads from an irregular wave spectrum.

	<li><b>Event-setup from file when running batch.</b>
	When running FEDEM batch from the command-line, a simulation event definition file
	may be specified as command-line argument.

	<li><b>Automatic export of all curves in a Graph group.</b>
	The automatic export may be toggled on/off for all curves in the selected Graph group
	through two new right-click commands in the Model Manager Results list.

	<li><b>Search path for the sn_curves.fsn and units.fcd files</b>
	If edited versions of these two files are located in the home-directory of the user profile,
	they are loaded instead of the default files located in the installation folder.

	<li><b>Directional wave distribution.</b>
	The JONSWAP sea wave spectrum function may now be defined with multiple wave directions.
	The visualization of the sea waves is then performed on a 2D rectangular grid.

	<li><b>Copying of Subassemblies.</b>
	A Subassembly may now be duplicated by choosing "Copy Subassembly" from the right-click menu.
	All the objects in that Subassembly are then duplicated.

	<li><b>Center of Gravity for Subassemblies.</b>
	Property fields reporting the Center of Gravity for Subassemblies have been added.
</ul>


<h2>New features with release 7.0</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Wind turbine modeling.</b>
	We have extended our product offerings with a wind power specific edition of the software,
	to accommodate the specific needs of the wind power industries. This edition includes:
	<br><br><ul>
		<li><i>Turbine definition.</i>
		The turbine definition tool lets you easily create a working wind turbine model
		from a set of basic parameters. The main parameters are driveline type, bearings,
		tower base, driveline configuration, hub configuration and nacelle configuration.

		<li><i>Blade definition.</i>
		The Blade definition tool specifies a wind turbine blade.
		Both aerodynamic and structural properties are specified.
		The aerodynamic properties are used by the integrated <i>AeroDyn</i> module
		from NREL (<a href="http://wind.nrel.gov">wind.nrel.gov</a>),
		to calculate forces on the blades of the wind turbine.
		The calculated forces are then applied as loads on the structural model.

		<li><i>Airfoil definition.</i>
		The Airfoil definition tool is used for definition of drag, lift and moment
		coefficients for airfoil sections.
		We use the same Airfoil format as is used in the latest version of <i>AeroDyn</i>.

		<li><i>Tower definition.</i>
		The Tower definition tool is used to define a tower representation
		by automatic generation of beam element sections.
		The turbine model does not require a separate tower assembly,
	 	it may therefore be deleted after the wind turbine model has been generated.
		This makes it easier to model turbines where the tower is an integrated part
		of the support structure modelled externally and imported as a Spaceframe/Jacket or FE part.

		<li><i>Air environment.</i>
		The Air environment tool is used to specify the global air environment for the wind turbine.
		We can use a constant wind field with a specific wind speed or use more complex/turbulent
		wind fields by the <i>TurbWind</i> tool.

		<li><i>TurbWind tool.</i>
		The turbulent wind tool is used to generate turbulent wind files for FEDEM WindPower.
		FEDEM TurbWind is basically a dialog box front-end for the <i>TurbSim</i> tool from NREL.
		FEDEM WindPower sends characteristic parameters of the wind turbine to FEDEM TurbWind,
		such as grid height, time step, duration, output folder, hub height, reference height, etc.

		<li><i>Output of wind speed on blade tip Triads.</i>
		The wind speed at the tip Triad of each wind turbine blade is avaliable for plotting.
		In addition, a set of user-defined points may be defined on an additional solver input file
		(extension .fsi) for measuring the wind speed at arbitrary fixed points.

		<li><i>SESAM .wind file extension for exported graphs.</i>
		This is the same as the ASCII file format without the header information.
	</ul>

	<li><b>Marine modeling.</b>
	We have further extended our software product with several features to support modelling
	of structures in Marine evironments. Among these features are the following:
	<br><br><ul>
		<li><i>Sea environment.</i>
		The new Sea environment dialog box is used to specify some global settings related
		to the sea, such as the water density, mean sea level, water depth, wave direction, etc.
		It also contains fields for definition of marine growth on submerged beam elements.

		<li><i>Sea wave and current functions.</i>
		We have added two new function groups for representing sea waves and current.

		<li><i>JONSWAP sea wave spectrum.</i>
		Wave kinematics may be represented by JONSWAP sea wave spectrum functions.

		<li><i>3D-visualization of sea state.</i>
		The mean sea level, water depth, and orientation of the wave and current
		coordinate system may be visualized as a blue box in the 3D view.

		<li><i>Plotting of wave elevation.</i>
		The wave elevation at the global origin (x=0,y=0,z=0)
		is available as a result quantitiy in the Result Selector.

		<li><i>Hydrodynamic load calculation.</i>
		Drag and added mass loads on slender beams based on the Morison equation.
		Buoyancy is also accounted for.

		<li><i>Import of Beamstrings.</i>
		Beamstrings are chains of beam elements that can be used to model flexible risers,
		mooring lines, etc. Such Beamstrings may be defined on a simple text file that
		is imported into FEDEM. The Beamstring definition file contains structural
		properties for the beam and hydrodynamic load coefficients.

		<li><i>Import of Soil Pile.</i>
		A Soil Pile is a special type of Beamstring which is connected to ground by a
		set of nonlinear springs. Soil Piles may be defined on a simple text file that
		is imported into FEDEM. The Soil Pile definition file contains structural properties
		of the pile, and nonlinear spring data at different depth levels (p-y curves).

		<li><i>Import of Spaceframes.</i>
		A Spaceframe is any assembly of beam elements. They may be defined in any of the
		supported file formats for FE parts, and imported into FEDEM. However, the FE part
		will now not become a superelement that is reduced. Instead, each individual beam
		element in the FE model is treated as a nonlinear element on the system level.
		In addition, point mass elements defined on the FE data file are converted to
		additional mass on the Triads, whereas defined ground springs are converted to
		Free Joints to ground with the possibility for off-diagonal coupling stiffnesses.
		The Spaceframe import accounts also for BNBCD entries in SESAM fem-files,
		such that DOFs with status code Fixed are set accordingly on the
		generated Triad in the FEDEM model.

		<li><i>Added mass from internal fluid in beam elements.</i>
		The calculation of added mass from internal fluid supports
		separate fluid densities (and level) for the different Beamstrings and Soil Piles.
		Spaceframe/Jacket elements are assumed to be filled with sea water only.

		<li><i>Response amplitude operators.</i>
		A response amplitude operator (RAO) is used to derive the motion of a vessel floating
		in the sea, when subjected to waves from a given direction. The RAO is given as
		tables of motion amplitudes and phase delays, as function of frequency, and may be
		imported into FEDEM to create <i>Vessel Motion</i> objects. They may then be connected
		to a Triad or a Free Joint to apply the motion on the structure.
	</ul>

	<li><b>Beam cross section and Material property objects.</b>
	We have added Beam cross section and Material property objects for improved flexibility
	in representations of Beam cross sections and Materials.
	Structural and hydrodynamic properties can be defined and edited.

	<li><b>Beam and turbine blade visualization.</b>
	We have added automatic 3D visualization of circular beam cross sections and blade profiles.
	The 3D visualization may be toggled on/off for individual beam elements through the property panel.
	The visualization of all beam elements of a specific Subassembly may also be toggled on/off
	through right-clicking the assembly node in the object tree.

	<li><b>Beamstring pair definition.</b>
	This tool enables easy coupling of two Beamstrings for pipe-in-pipe constructions.
	It will basically set up Free Joints between the overlapping Triads of the two Beamstrings.
	Arbitrary spring functions can be used for setting the contact clearance and stiffness.

	<li><b>Beam force graph.</b>
	We have added a new command for creation of Graphs plotting all the
	force components at the selected Triad(s) or Beam(s).
	The command is available from the right-click menu in the objects tree view under the <i>Result</i> sub-menu,
	when one or more Triads or Beams are selected.

	<li><b>Simulation events.</b>
	Simulation events may be defined in an ASCII file and imported into FEDEM. They may contain certain
	perturbations of the current model, and is an efficient tool to perform multiple load case simulations.
	The simulation events may be executed in parallel for optimal performance.

	<li><b>Event definition dialog.</b>
	The Event Definition dialog box is used to get an overview of the simulation event setup of the model.
	"Events" are used to define specific conditions in the FEDEM model, with specific properties,
	that are used when solving the model for these varying conditions.

	<li><b>Object browser dialog.</b>
	A new object browser dialog box displaying all model file fields has been added.
	This is useful when setting up simulation event definitions.

	<li><b>Multiselect from topology window.</b>
	All items in the topology window can be selected by right-clicking and choosing the "Select all" option.

	<li><b>Basic solver dialog.</b>
	We have added a simpler solver dialog for the basic functionality most often needed.
	The new dialog is an extension on top of the previous advanced dynamics solver dialog.
	The basic solver dialog also contains support for quasi-static solver configurations.

	<li><b>SESAM FEM file format.</b>
	The SESAM input interface file format is now supported when importing FE parts.

	<li><b>Fatigue summary interface.</b>
	With this tool you can do a fatigue summary analysis on any graph or set of curves in FEDEM.
	Just select a graph or set of curves, right click them, and choose "Fatigue Summary..".
	If you have multiple events in your model, the fatigue summary will be calculated for each event.

	<li><b>Optional header in exported ASCII files.</b>
	When exporting graphs to ASCII file, the text header may be excluded through a toggle.
	This is useful when the file is to be imported into SESAM or other systems which cannot handle headers.

	<li><b>Graph group defintions.</b>
	Graphs may now be defined in groups and stored in separate model files.
	This is useful when having multiple almost identical models, where the result sets are to be the same.

	<li><b>Pan by right-click.</b>
	The model may now be panned in the 3D view by right-click-and-hold while moving the mouse.

	<li><b>64-bit version.</b>
	A 64-bit version is now available on Windows for all the program modules.

	<li><b>Help system and documentation.</b>
	We have significantly enhanced the help system and documentation of the software.
	A start guide is offered when users start the software to provide links to educational videos,
	chapters in the User's Guide and the new Reference Guide.
